## Summary
![Screenshot of application](IMG3.png)

This application should take user input in for a team through the terminal.

Once the information for the team is complete, a team.html is created which holds the cards for each team member.

## Development

My biggest challenge for this homework was being able to keep track of the flow of information.

I understand the individual components of getting inputs from inquirer, creating classes, and creating an html page. Connecting them were the real challenge.

I plan on revisiting this hw to make it functional.
